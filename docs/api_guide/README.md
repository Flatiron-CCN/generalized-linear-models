Familiarize with NeMoS modules and learn how to take advantage of the `pynapple` and `scikit-learn` compatibility.

??? attention "Additional requirements (click to expand/collapse)""
    To run the tutorials, you may need to install some additional packages used for plotting and data fetching. These are included in the `[docs]` dependencies, along with other packages used for generating the documentation.
    If you only need the packages required for the examples, you can install them separately:
    ```
    pip install scikit-learn dandi matplotlib seaborn pooch
    ```
    Alternatively, if you prefer to install all documentation-related dependencies, use:
    ```
    pip install nemos[docs]
    ```
