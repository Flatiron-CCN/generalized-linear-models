    Parameters
    ----------
    basis_matrix : array
    	Matrix holding 1d basis functions,

    time_series : array 
        Matrix holding multivariate time series,

    -------
    convolved_series : array
        Result of convolution between all pairs of
        features and basis functions,
        shape == (N, B, T - W + 1).

    Notes
    -----
    For example, `time_series` could be a matrix of
    spike counts with `N` neurons and `T` timebins,
    and `basis_matrix` could be a matrix of `B`
    temporal basis functions with a window size of `W`.
